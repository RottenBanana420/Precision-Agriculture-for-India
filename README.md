# Precision Agriculture for India

This Python code is designed to serve as a Crop Recommendation System based on the given climatic conditions. It utilizes machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression to predict the most suitable crop for a set of environmental parameters, including Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall. The code also includes data visualization, clustering, and feature importance analysis.

## Libraries Used

`numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation 

`matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

`scikit-learn` for machine learning models and metrics

`ipywidgets` for creating interactive UI

`KMeans` for clustering analysis
## Usage

- Clone the repository.
- Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt.`
- Run the Python script and follow the prompts to input climatic conditions for crop recommendation.
